平面交通路口最优算法模型
2015年10月
	本人经过多年对北京道路和路口的观察，结合对道路交通的数学模型分析，得出结论，在城市的交通拥堵中，交通路口的通过能力是最大最核心的瓶颈问题。经过对路口的数学模型分析，认为其效率还有较大的提升空间，提高路口通过和交换能力将极大改善城市道路交通拥堵状态。
	该方案是：对复用路口的有限资源设计而形成的路口结构，巧妙设计的通过规则，如图所示是一个典型的道路结构和通行规则，直接提高效率达20~50%；还能满足城市目前和未来交通满负荷下的顺畅运行，在理论上也是唯一一种实质性改进，是解决大城市公共交通拥堵的必然选择，在占用同等资源的情况下，通行能力达到峰值。本方案具有普遍适用性，无论左、右侧通行规则；该方案有低成本、占地少的优势，某些情况下只需改变路口划线和交通灯。
	
	本人为此路口的数学模型用C++做了一个初级的仿真和演示软件，如附图所示即为软件运行截图经过编辑而成，还有详细的理论分析和各种情况下的图解说明。
	见《平面十字路口交通通过率极限算法演示视频.avi》
	
 

本方案是平面交通路口数学算法上的最优模型，但是这个方案存在着修改交通规则、交通灯多的障碍，影响了项目的推广。所以我把这个方案做了实例化工作，设计完成了城市里几种典型交通节点改进方案，这些方案更具实用性，准备申请四个实用新型专利。

这些方案将在道路建设总成本、占地面积、车辆流量和交换量、司机和行人出行舒适度等方面有大幅改善。

	计划针对国内交通极度拥堵城市的交通节点用unity3D做3D动态仿真模型实验，统计计算出准确的分析数据；参考下图：
 
后来，改用vissim做了仿真：

我还有一个立交桥的交通最优算法模型，是一个很魔幻的方案，重点研究超大型城市立交桥的高通过率和高交换律结合的课题，将在后期的新存储库中提交


Optimal algorithm model of plane traffic intersection

October 2015

After years of observation of roads and intersections in Beijing, combined with the analysis of the mathematical model of road traffic, I come to the conclusion that in the urban traffic congestion, the passing capacity of traffic intersections is the biggest and core bottleneck problem. Through the analysis of the mathematical model of the intersection, it is considered that there is still much room to improve its efficiency, and improving the crossing and exchange capacity of the intersection will greatly improve the urban road traffic congestion.

The scheme is as follows: the intersection structure formed by the design of the limited resources of the reused intersection, the ingenious design of the passing rules, as shown in the figure, is a typical road structure and passing rules, which directly improves the efficiency by 20 ~ 50%; In theory, it is also the only substantial improvement. It is the inevitable choice to solve the public traffic congestion in big cities. In the case of occupying the same resources, the traffic capacity reaches the peak. This scheme has universal applicability, regardless of the left and right traffic rules; The scheme has the advantages of low cost and less land occupation. In some cases, it only needs to change the crossing line and traffic lights.

I use C + + to do a primary simulation and demonstration software for the mathematical model of this intersection. As shown in the attached figure, it is a screenshot of the software running, edited, and detailed theoretical analysis and illustration in various cases.

See demonstration video of limit algorithm of traffic passing rate at horizontal intersection.avi

This scheme is the optimal model of plane traffic intersection mathematical algorithm, but there are many obstacles in this scheme, such as modifying traffic rules and traffic lights, which affect the promotion of the project. So I have done the instantiation work of this scheme, designed several typical traffic node improvement schemes in the city, these schemes are more practical, and I am going to apply for four utility model patents.

These plans will greatly improve the total cost of road construction, floor area, vehicle flow and exchange volume, and the travel comfort of drivers and pedestrians.

Plan to do 3D dynamic simulation model experiment with unity3d for traffic nodes in domestic cities with extremely congested traffic, and calculate the accurate analysis data; Refer to the figure below:

Later, VISSIM was used for simulation

See traffic intersection plane algorithm - 3D subtitle vis.mp4

I also have a traffic optimal algorithm model of overpass, which is a magic scheme. It focuses on the research of the combination of high passing rate and high exchange law of super large urban overpass, which will be submitted in the later new repository
